Sensory_Motor_Integration_Project

This project centers around finding out how saccades perpetuate visual and motor integration within a scene. The current (9/11/19) codes are the first three rudimentary stimuli that once completely finishe will be shown to subjects to get a baseline.
In order to run the code, Psychtoolbox must be downloaded in conunction with having Matlab.
